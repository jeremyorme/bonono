# Bonono

Bonono is a simple peer-to-peer data store that provides:

* Automatic replication
* Load time complexity of O(N_entries) 
* Public access control (read, read/write, read-all/write-own, none)

Why is it called Bonono? Simple, Opple sounded too silly.

**DISCLAIMER**: Bonono is alpha software.

# API reference

See the [Bonono API reference](main/doc/api/README.md).

# Roadmap

There are no specific plans to add functionality to Bonono at this point. Work is currently underway on a comprehensive demonstration app with the intention of proving the performance of Bonono and ironing out any issues prior to releasing version 1.0.0.
